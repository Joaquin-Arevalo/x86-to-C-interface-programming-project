iii) Take a screenshot of the program output, including the correctens check (x86-64)

The analysis compared the performance of the x86-64 implementation versus the C implementation across multiple tests. The x86-64 implementation consistently demonstrated superior performance across all tests, showcasing its efficiency in execution time compared to the C implementation. This suggests potential optimizations or inherent performance advantages within the x86-64 architecture, especially in release mode, for these specific tasks.
